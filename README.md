# Autonomous-robot-car

Built an autonomous one-tenth scale car that runs on ODROID XU4 using RGB-D camera data. 

Features like corridor navigation in a race circuit, obstacle avoidance, backing out of a collision and continuing driving,
taking and landing a jump, and stop sign detection were implemented.
